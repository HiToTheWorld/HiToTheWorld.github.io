        #A new roblox horror game
        Written by rabitailleow, feat. @th3elixer

        ##Concept
        ###Setting
        You and your friends(if you have any) go spelunking, in a cave in the desert. It's super dark and you only have a flashlight that has limited power. There are lots of tunnels, streams, and crevasses.

        ###Recources
        As I said in the previous paragraph, you have water from streams and a flashlight to help you get around. The flashlight, though, has limited power and can die anytime soon. There are crates around, hidden in lots of places, that contain small amounts of food and clean water for everyone in your party. The crates also have batteries to keep your flashlight charged for another 30 seconds to a minute, depending on how long it has been in the box.

        <!-- ###Horror

        An update will be coming soon.
